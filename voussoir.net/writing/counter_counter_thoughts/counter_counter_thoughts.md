Counter-counter-thoughts
========================

Thought: I should write a post with my thoughts about \_\_*blank*\_\_.

Counter-thought: The internet is already overflowing with people doing this, my take isn't unique, I don't have any novel information.

Counter-counter-thought: Who cares, it's my blog, text is cheap, maybe someone will find it interesting.

Counter-counter-counter-thought: I am contributing to the slow death of the internet as it is crushed under the weight of 7 billion people who think their thoughts need to be published for some reason.

Thought: I should share my thoughts about \_\_*blank*\_\_.

Counter-thought: "It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt"

Counter-counter-thought: Oh please not again.

Counter-counter-counter-thought: "Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something"

Counter-counter-counter-counter-thought: `git push`
