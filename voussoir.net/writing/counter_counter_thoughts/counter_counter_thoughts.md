Counter-counter-thoughts
========================

Thought: I should write a post with my thoughts about \_\_*blank*\_\_.

Counter-thought: The internet is already overflowing with people doing this, my take isn't unique, I don't have any novel information.

Counter-counter-thought: Who cares, it's my blog, text is cheap, maybe someone will find it interesting.

Counter-counter-counter-thought: I am contributing to the slow death of the internet as it is crushed under the weight of 7 billion people who think their thoughts need to be published for some reason.
