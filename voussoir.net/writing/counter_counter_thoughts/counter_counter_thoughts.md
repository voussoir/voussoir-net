Counter-counter-thoughts
========================

Thought: I should write a post with my thoughts about \_\_*blank*\_\_.

Counter-thought: The internet is already overflowing with people doing this, my take isn't unique, I don't have any novel information.

Counter-counter-thought: Who cares, it's my blog, text is cheap, maybe someone will find it interesting.

Counter-counter-counter-thought: I am contributing to the slow death of the internet as it is crushed under the weight of 7 billion people who think their thoughts need to be published for some reason.

Here's a hackernews post called [What is your blog?](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22800136). [shadowsun7](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22800825) says "My hard rule with the blog is that I should (as much as possible) write only about things I can verify through practice. None of that 'it sounds insightful because it is novel, but actually I came up with it in the shower and I've not actually tested it in real life'" to which [\_curious\_](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22803222) responded "If only more bloggers held the same standard, the internet would be a better place".

Meanwhile, [swyx](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22803399) shared his "Learn in public" article, encouraging more publishing and "let the internet correct you when you are inevitably wrong". Does the doing-over-lurking mentality produce better individual results, but at the cost of polluting the internet for everybody else with permanent obelisks of bad early efforts? He even uses the phrase "learning exhaust".

Thought: I should share my thoughts about \_\_*blank*\_\_.

Counter-thought: "It is better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak and remove all doubt"

Counter-counter-thought: Oh please not again.

Counter-counter-counter-thought: "Wise men speak because they have something to say; fools because they have to say something"

Counter-counter-counter-counter-thought: `git push`
