> Hi David,

> A long time ago I discovered your film commentary for Birdman and I thought it was excellent, so I downloaded it. Just a moment ago, I wanted to find the Youtube link again, and saw that it was deleted :(

> On your website you said someone messed up your channel and you reuploaded what you could, but I notice Birdman is still missing. Did you lose your local copy of that? Would you like me to send you the copy that I downloaded?

> Regards

> Ethan

From David to Ethan

> Wow, that's so kind of you! Yeah, I think someone shoulder surfed me after I asked them to stop smoking on the bus, they deleted all my google-related material. I could get it all back except YouTube.

> If you have a copy of that and could get it to me it would be so awesome! First of all it's very flattering you watched/listened to and liked it enough to keep, I love that movie (I live in New York now, I didn't then, and have made pilgrimages to all the filming locations) and it broke my heart it disappeared.

> Thanks so much,

> David

> That's terrible, I'm sorry to hear that. This is why I download the stuff that I like, you never know what'll happen!

> At the time that I watched it, I didn't realize you were also a Python programmer and artist too. I've been doing Python for about 6 years myself. It's always cool to see other people who have both programming & film hobbies.

> If you have any other commentary ideas on the backburner, I would really encourage you to make them! I wish I had enough to say about any particular movie to do one of these myself.

> Enjoy the rest of your weekend

> Thanks so much for that! I've started a `[spoiler alert!]` commentary like three times, now that I'm in social distancing maybe I'll work on it!
